# Comparative analysis of traditional and Blockchain game asset trading platform

## 1.	Introduction: 
Generally, there are two kinds of assets circulating in the game, one is game coins, the other is props, which form the economic system of the game. And this so-called economic system is hyper-centralized and usually closed, which means only the game developers have the right to issue and price the game assets, players can trade their props in built-in trading platform but have to pay game developers a fee, and the trade is in game coins. If you want to trade game assets in fiat currency, third-party platforms and middlemen play an important role. In a word, main parties in the game asset trading industry are: the players; game developers, third-party platforms and middlemen.

## 2.	Analysis of traditional trading platforms
Traditional game asset trading platforms can be divided into the built-in game trading platform and the third-party platform according to the institutional attributes of the service provided. In addition, due to the high degree of freedom, some players also choose to trade in the game community, but such informal situations are often fraudulent due to lack of protection.

In China, according to the data published by GPC and Gamma Data, the game market is gradually expanding. The actual sales revenue increases from 18.56 billion in 2008 to 214.44 billion in 2018.

Relying on the vigorous development of China's game industry over the years, the virtual good trading market has formed a mature industrial chain, and gradually developed  different business models suitable for the development of different trading platforms. Currently, the relatively well-known game asset trading platforms include: the old trading platform that has been established since 2002, 5173.com，and the large-scale integrated e-commerce platform Taobao. The trading service provided by these platforms have promoted the prosperity of the virtual good trading market in China. 

According to the iResearch statistics, the size of China's game item trading market, excluding the transaction of time card, reached 11.33 billion yuan in 2013, more than 1/10 of the overall market size of China's online games. As for the market share of China's virtual good trading platform, 5173.com has a market share of 49.8%, accounting for half of the market.  5173.com ranked first in the number of games involved in the  realized virtual good transactions, and also the type and number of game items. Taobao and Paipai ranked second and third with market share of 10.5%. and 7.0% respectively. In addition to these platforms that maintain market leadership, other trading platforms also have a good performance in the market. The tail market consisting of small and medium-sized trading platforms has a total market share of 24.7%. In recent years, the game items trading market is even bigger. According to the white paper of WAX published in March, 2018, each year, more than 400 million gamers purchase more than $50 billion in virtual items worldwide.

Among those trading platforms, most of them adopt C2C mode, which is suitable for game players to trade. The trading platform built in by game developers is generally of B2C mode, game developers will directly sell and acquire game assets. With the development of e-commerce, the C2B2C mode has also been tried in the game field. Players temporarily put the virtual assets to the platform for custody, and the platform would inform the seller to conduct online transactions.

The revenue of the traditional game platform is mainly derived from transaction fees, advertising fees, fees from guarantee and consignment service, etc. The fee for game trading platforms in China is between 5% and 10%, the overseas Steam is up to 15%, and Opskins is about 10%. Actually, the charge of Steam up to 15% encourages the development of OPSkins and other third-party platforms. In order to attract users, some newly established game trading platforms have adopted a free-of-charge mode.

However, there are several problems in the operation of traditional platforms. Firstly, it’s about the property of the game assets. Generally, game developers have the ownership of the game and also the ownership of the data generated by players during. Game developers have the right to issue new props and game coins, which may lead to inflation in the in-game economy, increasing the uncertainty of game assets. Moreover, game developers could ban the operation of certain player or shut down the game, which indicates players only have the right to use game assets, but not have the proprietorship. Once the game is shut down, players may lose everything that they have devoted into the game. In a word, a highly centralized trading system makes the value of game assets uncertain and difficult to transfer between platforms. 

Secondly, the introduction of third-party platforms may lead to security issues. The traditional trading market needs to go through third-party intermediaries to ensure the delivery or the payment, and to confirm that both parties have fulfilled their respective obligations. But for trading platforms, as the only authority, it is difficult and costly to avoid Man-in-the-middle attack nor payment fraud. It is estimated that for every legitimate virtual purchase made, there are 7.5 virtual items lost to fraud. (enjin) 

Thirdly, liquidity is another major obstacle for gamers. Traditional platforms are restricted by geographical factor, settlement currency, or transaction cost, which will lead to information asymmetry among buyers and sellers from different regions. Without direct and smooth communication between buyers and sellers, buyers find price too high or sellers can’t sell quickly because there is not matched demand. Also, the transaction cost due to foreign exchange or bank charges may be extremely high to harm the interest of both parties.

## 3.	Blockchain trading platforms
Blockchain game asset trading platforms can be divided into game asset trading and service platform, which provides not only the platform for virtual asset transaction and circulation, but also provides services like incubation, resource docking, technology support; and pure game asset trading platform, which can also be categorized  into two classes: 1) platform dedicated to game props trading, trading objects consisting of blockchain game props, traditional game props and software; and 2) third-party NFT (non-fungible tokens) trading platform focused on non-fungible asset transactions. 

Blockchain trading platform completes missions that traditional platform cannot complete. First of all, it provides transparency, clarifying the ownership of game assets, enhancing the asset property of game props and making supply and transaction history of all virtual assets in the market visible. For the traditional game assets, the blockchain trading platform uses the SDK/API method to tokenize the game asset, to trade and transfer it on the chain. For the NFT trading platform, each virtual asset is a unique Token, and stored in the user’s blockchain account by encryption. Safety, reliability and ownership completely belonging to users greatly enhance the value of virtual assets. The virtual assets stored on the chain can use the smart contract to conduct frictionless peer-to-peer transactions in a trusted environment. All the transaction history is traceable and tamper-resistant to ensure authenticity. 

Moreover, in traditional games or trading platforms, there is no consensus on the total amount of game items. The tasks in the game are constantly refreshed, which means the Token distribution in the game is unlimited and unregulated and people doesn’t know how many game items are going into the circulation. Also, the total supply and demand of certain item in the traditional trading market is unrevealed. It’s a completely free but yet opaque market. But tokenization on the blockchain could give everyone a window to understand the size of the economy from a macro level, creating a consensus for everyone, especially when traditional game developers actively use smart contracts to identify the total number of items that will be issued.

What’s more, it realizes value exchange between games, and between games and coins in a decentralized system. Blockchian refactors the relationship between games. Assets can be used in different games, mainly different games from the same operators, avoiding the situation once the game operator closed certain game, players would lose all the game assets in that game. To some extent, it’s a protection to the interest of players. Also, the economic system of the game is open. If the game itself contains a native Token, the Token can be exchanged with other mainstream coins on the chain. The native Token of various games, combined with the mainstream underlying chain coin, form an exchange system similar to the real world.

In my opinion, the most suitable example to demonstrate the advantages of blockchain trading platform is WAX platform, since it’s developed from OPSkins. OPSkins is one of the world’s largest centralized platforms for video game asset traders. Backed by its own traditional platform, especially millions of users of game skin transactions, OPSkins deployed a decentralized e-commerce chain WAX (Worldwide Asset eXchange), aiming to facilitate the high-frequency and cross-border transactions.

WAX adopts DPoS (Delegated proof of stake) consensus algorithm, with selected confirming nodes named “Guilds”. Under DPoS system, confirming nodes are elected by users who pledge votes to proposed delegates. Holders of WAX Tokens will be able to submit proposals to the network. Users will vote for the submitted proposals of potential Guilds, as well as existing Guilds. This so-called DPoS create sufficient decentralization to ensure a secure exchange.  

Four types of accounts are included in the system: user accounts, guilds, transfer agents and contracts. User accounts should list their virtual assets on the WAX platform, including the basic information and the price. Delivery time for the seller to deliver to the Transfer Agent is also included, and reflects the overall price of the asset; shorter delivery times incur a higher fee, but less time to complete. As for the purchase of game assets, buyers send a transaction to the listing contract. Thanks to the WAX platform, buyers and sellers can deal directly with each other at lower cost, the pattern is similar to e-commerce platform like Amazon and Taobao. 
WAX platform has its native Token. Small amount of WAX token is used during transactions and messages, as a fee for using the network, which will be used to incentive the Guilds, similar to ETH Gas and Bitcoin fees. Meanwhile, virtual goods’ sales prices are listed in WAX Token; the buy and sell operations are settled in WAX Tokens.  But other currencies are permitted, the listing agent plays the role to convert the other currency into WAX Token at the current exchange rate at the time of purchase.

As a traditional third-party trading platform, OPSkins takes the initiative to update the service framework. It issues a WAX public blockchain based on ERC20 protocol, and transfers part of the transactions to the blockchain. In fact, it wants to improve its high-frequency and cross-border service with the help of the characteristics of blockchain. In a word，trading in traditional platforms is time-consuming and costly，and it's more possible to result in payment fraud. In these two aspects，blockchain platforms are better. Actually, its action has paid off. WAX public blockchain ranked seven according to the number of operations on the blockchain during the last 24 hours (updated 2019-05-01).

## 4. Conclusion
Traditional game asset trading platform is lack of transparency and hyper-centralized to game developers.  The introduction of third-party intermediaries increases the possibility of payment fraud. The transactions in such platforms are always time-consuming and costly, high transaction costs do harm to the interest of buyers and sellers. However, Blockchain has several unique characteristics. Its decentralized distributed ledger makes all the listed items and transaction history traceable and temper-resistant, which dramatically reduces the probability of payment fraud or Man-in-the-middle attack. Its uniform and standardized Token makes the transaction easy and fast and has little transaction cost. The adoption of Blockchain in the game asset trading market creates a transparent and open ecosystem, which is a protection to the interest of buyers and sellers.
